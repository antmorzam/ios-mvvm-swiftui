# Technical test for SEAT-CODE

## Description
This project is a technical test implemented in SwiftUI, following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern.

## Libraries (Swift Package Manager)
- **Polyline:** This library interprets the results consistent with the polylines generated by the Google Maps SDK for iOS.
- **SnapshotTesting:** It performs a pixel-based comparison of two images: a reference image and a candidate image.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:antmorzam/ios-mvvm-swiftui.git`
2. Open the project in Xcode: `open ios-mvvm-swiftui.xcodeproj`
3. Run the project.

## Dependencies Injection
The project uses a dependency injection approach to facilitate component management and improve code testability.

## Snapshot Testing
- When an assertion first runs, a snapshot is automatically recorded to disk and the test will fail, printing out the file path of any newly-recorded reference.
- Repeat test runs will load this reference and compare it with the runtime value. If they don't match, the test will fail and describe the difference.
